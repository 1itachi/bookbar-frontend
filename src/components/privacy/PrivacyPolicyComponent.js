                <h3>Purpose of the website:</h3>
                Our website, referred to as BookBar hereon, is aimed at providing an alternative
                solution overcoming the shortcomings of the physical bookstores. The website acts as
                a convenient
                platform to connect both buyers and sellers obviating the hassles involved with
                the physical stores. A seller can post all the required details of a book like
                price, different forms of availability, available quantity, etc. A buyer can
                browse the website, find the details of the books they are interested in and
                place an order to be delivered to his place. All this happens without the need
                to leave the comfort of your seat. The website connects sellers and buyers from across the
                globe and payments can be made online.
